# PART C

This section explains the packet flow between frontend and backend pods, which are on different Kubernetes nodes, in four phases.


# 8. Phase 1 - Frontend Pod to Service

The flow that will be explained in this section is shown below.

![](2020-09-16-17-49-42.png)

Basically this flow is frontend pod accessing the backendsvc service on TCP port 80. Backendsvc service is backed by backend1 and backend2 pod, as shown in kubectl outputs in section 3.2.

At this stage, the current flow has the following values in the Ethernet and IP headers.

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (Frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.104.65.133 (Backendsvc service IP)
- Source MAC = be:2c:bf:e4:ec:c5 (Frontend pod MAC)
- Destination MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)

This flow will be matched against a flow entry in each OVS Table, processed top to bottom in each individual table, based on the priority value of the flow entry in the table.

## 8.1 Classifier Table #0

Table #0 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>

vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

This table is to classify the traffic by matching it on the ingress port and then setting the register NXM_NX_REG0[0..15] bits as following; "0" for tunnel, "1" for local gateway and "2" for local pod.  The current flow in this scenario, which is initiated from frontend pod and comes to OVS on the frontend pod interface, matches the <b>sixth</b> flow entry in the above output (which is highlighted). First action in this flow entry is to set the value of the register reg0[0..15] to "0x2", which means flow comes from a local pod. Second action in the same flow entry is to hand over the flow to next table which is Table 10. (resubmit(,10))  

So next stop is Table 10.

**Note :** "0x" means that it is hexadecimal. For example, 

- "0x2" is 2 Ã— (16 to the power of 0) = 2 x 1 = 2
- or "0x20" is 2 x (16 to the power of 1) + 0 x (16 to the power of 0)  =  32 + 0 = 32

## 8.2 Spoofguard Table #10

Table #10 on Worker 1 node is shown below. "nw_src" refers to the IP address and "dl_src" refers to the MAC address of the pod connected to the respective OF port.

vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

What this table does is verifying if the source IP and MAC of the the traffic matches the IP and MAC assigned to the Pod by Antrea CNI plugin during initial Pod wiring. It implements this check both for IP and ARP traffic.

Highlighted lines in the above output are the respective ARP and IP check entries for the OF port which the frontend pod is connected to. In this instance this is an IP flow from frontend pod to backend service hence the current flow will match the second line from the bottom. Notice, in the same flow entry, once the spoofguard check is successful then the flow is handed over to Table 30 (actions=resubmit(,30)). Table 30 is the next stop.

## 8.3 Conntrack Table #30

Table #30 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

Conntrack table' s job is to start tracking all the traffic. ("ct" action means connection tracking) Any flow that goes through this table will be in "tracked" (trk) state. In generic networking security terms this functionality makes the OVS a stateful connection aware component. Flow then gets handed over to the next table which is Table 31; as seen in the "actions" section of the flow entry (actions=ct(table=31,)). Next stop is Table 31.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=30 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=30, priority=200,ip <b>actions=ct(table=31,zone=65520)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

**Note :** "Zone" is explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/ovs-pipeline.md#conntracktable-30) as following : "A ct_zone is simply used to isolate connection tracking rules. It is similar in spirit to the more generic Linux network namespaces, but ct_zone is specific to conntrack and has less overhead." 

## 8.4 ConntrackState Table #31

Table #31 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=31 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=210,<b>ct_state=-new+trk</b>,ct_mark=0x20,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=200,<b>ct_state=-new+trk</b>,ct_mark=0x20,ip actions=load:0x4e9908c153be->NXM_OF_ETH_DST[],resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=190,<b>ct_state=+inv+trk</b>,ip actions=drop
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,40)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

ConntrackState table processes all the flows that are in tracked state (basically which were handed over by the Conntrack table 30). The first and second flow entries shown above process the flows where the flow is NOT new AND tracked. (ct_state=-new means not new, +trk means being tracked) The third flow entry processes the flows where the respective flow is INVALID and TRACKED, basically it drops all those flows. 

The current flow is a completely NEW flow from frontend pod to backendsvc service. Hence the current flow will match the <b>last entry</b> in the flow table highlighted above. Notice the action in that flow entry is handing the flow over to the next table which is table 40. (resubmit(,40)) Next stop is Table 40.

## 8.5 DNAT Table #40

Table #40 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=40 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1040000000000, table=40, priority=200,ip,<b>nw_dst=10.96.0.0/12</b> actions=mod_dl_dst:4e:99:08:c1:53:be,load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG1[],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[16],resubmit(,105)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=40, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,50)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

The table has only two flow entries. The first flow entry checks whether if the destination IP of the flow is part of the service CIDR range configured in the cluster (which is 10.96.0.0/12); if it does, then certain actions are taken on the flow to steer the flow to the antrea-gw0 interface on the Worker 1 node.  

The IP of the backendsvc service can be checked as below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl get svc
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
<b>service/backendsvc</b>   ClusterIP   <b>10.104.65.133</b>   <none>        80/TCP    2d1h
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP   7d1h
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

As shown above, 10.104.65.133 falls into the service CIDR range <b>hence the current flow will match the first flow entry</b> in the table and multiple actions will be taken on the flow.

The first action specified in the flow entry is rewriting the destination mac of the flow with "4e:99:08:c1:53:be" (mod_dl_dst:4e:99:08:c1:53:be); which is the MAC address of the gw0 (antrea-gw0) interface of the Worker 1 node. 

The second action specified in the flow entry is to set the "NXM_NX_REG1" bit to "0x2" (by load:0x2 in hex, which is 2 in decimal). This register represents the egress OF Port ID of the flow. (ie through which OF port this flow will be sent) And "2" is the OF Port ID for the antrea-gw0. The outputs and diagrams shown in [Part A Section 3.4](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_a#34-identifying-ovs-port-ids-of-port-ids) can be reviewed again to see OF Port ID.

The third action specified in the flow entry is setting the "NXM_NX_REG0[16]" to "1" (by load:0x1). This value in Reg0[16] means that OVS knows the destination MAC address. In other words this MAC address exists in OVS MAC address table (Table 80), which is explained in a seperate section. 

The fourth action in the flow entry is handing the flow over to the next table which is table 105 (resubmit(,105)). Next stop for this flow is Table 105.

**Note 1:** The flow is handed over to Table #105 and Egress tables (related to network policies), which are Table 45-49 and 50, are just bypassed, why ? Will be explained in an upcoming section.

**Note 2:** About the first action mentioned in the flow entry above, since the destination MAC in this flow is already the MAC address of the antrea-gw0 interface (cause frontend pod' s default gateway is gw0 interface IP) this rewrite action actually does not make any sense in this environment. Apparently this functionality was developed for a different use case and still exists but it actually does not affect anything. There is a PR for this which can be read [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/issues/1264).

**Note 3:** The Service CIDR range (10.96.0.0/12) is aligned to the kubeadm default service cidr range. If a specific range is used in "--service-cluster-ip-range" for kube-apiserver then the "serviceCIDR" variable in antrea configmap should also be configured with the same range so that the respective flow entry in Table 40 gets configured with the correct range.

## 8.6 ConnTrackCommit Table #105

Table 105 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=105 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=200,ct_state=+new+trk,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520,exec(load:0x20->NXM_NX_CT_MARK[]))
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=190,ct_state=+new+trk,ip actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,110)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table is for committing all the new flows for tracking them. This action is specifically explained as "Commit the connection to the connection tracking module which will be stored beyond the lifetime of packet in the pipeline." [in OVS docs](https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/tutorials/ovs-conntrack/).

The first flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). The same flow entry also checks if the flow is coming from the gateway interface. This is represented by reg0=0x1/0xffff. Explanation of this is as following. The second part "0xffff" instructs OVS to verify the first 16 bits in reg0, meaning reg0[0..15] and then the first part "0x1" means the result of that check should be "1". So it basically checks reg0[0..15]. The Reg0[0..15] is set in Classifier Table 10 and it is set to "1" if the flow comes from antrea-gw0 interface. However this flow is not coming from the gateway interface, it is coming from a local pod interface (frontend pod interface on OVS) 

The second flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). The action for this flow entry is committing this tracked flow to conntrack table (actions=ct(commit,..)) and then handing the flow over to the next table (,table=110).

In this case the current flow matches this <b>second</b> flow entry. It is a new flow from frontend pod to backendsvc service and it is being tracked (previously from Conntrack Table 30). Hence the current flow is committed to conntrack table (actions=ct(commit,..)) and then it is handed over to the next table (,table=110). So next stop is Table 110. 

## 8.7 L2ForwardingOut Table #110

Table 110 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

This table' s job is simple. First flow entry in this table first reads the value in register reg0[16]. If the value of this register is "1" in decimal, that means the destination MAC address is known to OVS and the flow should be able to get forwarded (otherwise it would get dropped). The same flow entry has an action defined as "actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]". What this action does is it reads the value in "NXM_NX_REG1" to determine the OF port this flow will be sent through and then sends the flow onwards to that port.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=110 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=200,ip,reg0=0x10000/0x10000 actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

The current flow' s reg0[16] bit was set to "0x1" (1 in decimal)  back in DNAT Table 40. and also the value of REG1 was set to "0x2" (2 in decimal) back in DNAT Table 40. "2" is the OF Port ID of antrea-gw0 interface. Hence the current flow is sent to onwards to the antrea-gw0 by OVS.

**Note :** The second flow entry in this table obviously drops the flows which do not have their "reg0[16]" register set.

The logic of "reg0=-0x10000/0x10000" in the flow entry is that the first 0x10000 is the desired value of this register. The second 0x10000 is the exact instructions on which specific bit(s) should be verified to match the desired value. Since "0x" is hexadecimal, below is a detailed explanation of the position of the bit that is verified. 

<pre><code>
23            16  15            8   7             0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>

## 8.8 IPTables

At this stage, the Kernel IP stack of Worker 1 node receives the flow from antrea-gw0 interface and the flow will  is processed by iptables NAT rules. Iptables NAT rules on Worker 1 node are shown below.

Basically Kube Services chain "KUBE-SVC-EKL7ZEFK3VFJKKGJ" applies destination NAT on flows destined to backendsvc service IP and picks either backend1 or backend2 as the destination. This is typical Kube-proxy managed, iptables driven "ClusterIP" type of Kubernetes service functionality which is providing distributed load balancing for flows within a Kubernetes cluster.

<pre><code>

Next phase is the flow being sent from backendsvc service to one of the backend pods backing that service and the processing of that flow is explained in the next section. 

# 9. Phase 2 - Service to Backend Pod 

In this section the assumption is that, in the previous phase, kube-proxy driven NAT rules in iptables translated the backendsvc service IP to the backend2 pod' s IP (which is on Worker 2 node) to service the request that came from the frontend pod in the previous section. 

As mentioned in the assumption above, the kube-proxy managed iptables NAT rule DNATed backendsvc IP (10.104.65.133) to backend2 pod IP (10.222.2.34). Basically this flow is the service to backend2 pod communication and it has the following values in the Ethernet and IP headers.

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Source MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)
- Destination MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (When the destination pod is on a different node this global virtual MAC is used. It is explained in Section 12) 

To verify how after iptables processing, the service to backend pod (backend2 pod in this case) flow is sent by antrea-gw0 interface to the OVS, a quick tcpdump on the antrea-gw0 interface on Worker 1 node would reveal the source and destination IP/MAC of this communication. It is shown below.

<pre><code>

The highlighted flow above will be matched against a flow entry in each OVS Table, processed top to bottom in each individual table, based on the priority value of the flow entry in the table.

## 9.1 Classifier Table #0

This table is to classify the traffic by matching it on the ingress port and then setting the register NXM_NX_REG0[0..15] bits as following; "0" for tunnel, "1" for local gateway and "2" for local pod. 

The current flow came from antrea-gw0 interface hence it matches the <b>first</b> flow entry in the above output (which is highlighted). The first action in this flow entry is to set the register reg0[0..15] to "0x1" since the flow comes from the local gateway. The second action in this flow entry is to hand over the flow to Table 10. (resubmit(,10)) Hence next stop is Table 10.

## 9.2 Spoofguard Table #10

What this table does is verifying if the source IP and MAC of the the traffic matches the IP and MAC assigned to the Pod by Antrea CNI plugin during initial Pod wiring. It implements this check both for IP and ARP traffic.

Since the flow comes from the antrea-gw0 interface, the flow will match the <b>first</b> flow entry in this table. The source IP of the current flow, which is coming from antrea-gw0 interface, is still the frontend pod IP (requestor of the original flow), hence spoofguard does not do any checks in this instance. The only action specified in the first flow entry is handing the flow over to Table 30 (actions=goto_table:30). So next stop is Table 30.

**Note :** Spoofguard does not do any checks for IP packets on the antrea-gw0 port. However it still checks the ARP flows on that port. Second entry in the table is used for that purpose. It basically checks the ARP flows/replies sent by the antrea-gw0 interface to the local pods running on Worker1 node.

## 9.3 ConntrackTable Table #30

Table #30 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=30 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=30, priority=200,ip <b>actions=ct(table=31</b>,zone=65520)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

Conntrack table' s job is to start tracking all the traffic. ("ct" action means connection tracking). Any flow that goes through this table will be in "tracked" (trk) state. In generic networking security terms this functionality makes the OVS a stateful connection aware component. Flow then gets handed over to the next table which is Table 31; as seen in the "actions" section of the flow entry. (actions=ct(table=31,)) So next stop is Table 31.

**Note :** Zone ID is explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/ovs-pipeline.md#conntracktable-30) as "A ct_zone is simply used to isolate connection tracking rules. It is similar in spirit to the more generic Linux network namespaces, but ct_zone is specific to conntrack and has less overhead." 

## 9.4 ConnTrackState Table #31

Table #31 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=31 --no-stats

vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

ConntrackState table processes all the flows that are in tracked state (basically which were handed over by the Conntrack table 30). The first and second flow entries shown above process the flows where the flow is NOT new AND tracked. (ct_state=-new means not new, +trk means being tracked) The third flow entry processes the flows where the respective flow is INVALID and TRACKED, basically it drops all those flows.

The current flow is a completely NEW flow - from frontend pod to backend2 pod. Hence the flow matches the <b>last entry</b> in the flow table highlighted above. Notice the action in the same flow entry is handing the flow over to the next table which is table 40 (resubmit(,40)). So next stop is Table 40.

**Note :** The current flow is actually the continuity of the previous flow, which was from frontend pod to backendsvc service. However that previous flow has been subject to DNAT process by iptables in Section 4.8. The destination IP of that previous flow has been changed (to backend2 pod IP) so the current flow, whose source IP is frontend pod IP and destination IP is now the backend1 pod IP, is a new flow. Hence it matches the last flow entry in Table 31. 

## 9.5 DNAT Table #40

Table #40 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=40 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1040000000000, table=40, priority=200,ip,w_dst=10.96.0.0/12 actions=mod_dl_dst:4e:99:08:c1:53:be,load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG1[],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[16],resubmit(,105)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=40, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,50)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table in essence checks whether if the flow is destined to a Kubernetes service so that it can redirect the flow to the antrea-gw0. 

The table has only two flow entries. The first flow entry checks whether if the destination IP of the flow is part of the service CIDR range configured in the cluster (which is 10.96.0.0/12); if it does, then certain actions are taken on the flow to steer the flow to the antrea-gw0 interface on the Worker 1 node.  

The destination IP of the current flow is backend2 pod IP (10.222.2.34) and it does not fall into the service CIDR range in the first flow entry in Table 40. Hence the current flow will match the second/last entry. The action specified in the last flow entry is to basically hand over the flow to Table 50 (actions=resubmit(,50)). So next stop is Table 50.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram at Antrea Project' s Github repo, there are tables 45-49 before Table50. However those tables are in use only when ClusterNetworkPolicy (CNP) feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, CNP is not used. 

## 9.6 EgressRule Table #50

At this stage, the flow is in Table 50. This table consists of the corresponding flow entries of the egress rules that are configured in Kubernetes Network Policies "frontendpolicy" and "backendpolicy" respectively. Cause there is a frontend pod and backend1 pod running on this Worker 2 node. This is the exact step where the current flow will be matched against the egress rules of the Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy"; the policy which is applied to the frontend pod since it is the initiator of the flow. 

However the flow in Phase 1 (Section 8) could not be matched against The Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy"; cause that flow' s destination IP was still the backendsvc service IP and Kubernetes Network Policy would not make an accurate check in that case and legitimate flows would have been blocked. This is the reason as to why the flow in Phase 1 bypasses the Egress Rule tables and gets redirected to antrea-gw0 interface onwards to Kernel IP stack for iptables rule processing. Only after kube-proxy managed iptables rules apply DNAT on that flow (in Phase 1), which essentially translates the destination backendsvc service IP to one of the backend pods IP, then the new flow in this current phase, which is Phase 2, can be processed by Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy" as will be explained in this step. 

The content of the "frontendpolicy" is shown below.

The egress section of this network policy is highlighted in the above output. In this network policy, egress HTTP to backend pods and egress DNS to anywhere is allowed and this policy is applied to the frontend pod. Remember, the current flow is still from frontend pod to one of the backend pods; hence the current flow is now subject to Kubernetes Network Policy' s egress rules that are applied to the frontend pod.

**Note :** The reason DNS is also allowed is, when the frontend pod sends a request to the backendsvc service by its name, a DNS query is sent by frontend pod to Kubernetes DNS so that frontend pod can call out one of the backend pods by their IPs, hence DNS has to be allowed to make this work. **As mentioned before, this article focuses on the actual application flow which occurs after the DNS query. In this section the flow from frontend pod to backend2 pod on TCP port 80 is explained.**

One thing to emphasize here again is that this table includes the egress rules of all the Kubernetes Network Policies applied to any of the pods on Worker 1 node (not only the egress rules configured on "frontendpolicy" and applied to frontend pod). Cause there is a frontend pod and a backend1 pod running on this Worker 1 node. However the focus in this section is on the flow entries which correspond to the egress rules of the Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy" which is applied to the frontend pod.

First thing to understand from above table is OVS uses "conjunctive" match across multiple fields alongside "conjunction" action. This enables OVS to optimize policy implementation without consuming too many flow entries.

The first flow entry in Table 50 above checks whether if the flow is an already established flow (-new,+trk); if it is then there is no need to process the flow against network policy, since Kubernetes Network Policy is STATEFUL by nature. However the current flow is a NEW flow hence it does NOT match this first flow entry.

The second flow entry matches against a given source or destination IP set. But there is no specific IP that this flow entry checks upon apparently. Same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "2".

The third flow entry matches against destination protocol, which is UDP 53 (DNS) in this case. Same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "2". 

The fourth flow entry matches against destination protocol, which is TCP 80 (HTTP) in this case. Same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "3".

The fifth flow entry matches against a specific source IP, which is frontend pod IP - 10.222.1.48. The same flow entry has a conjunction action with both an id of "2" and "3".

**Note :** The x/y notation in the conjunctions are to represent whether if the conjunction has multiple conditions to match.

<b>So conjunction 2 is fully implemented by second, third and fifth flow entries.</b> Conjunction 2 checks if the source IP address is 10.222.1.48 and if the destination protocol is UDP 53. This corresponds to the DNS specific rule in the egress section of the Kubernetes network policy named as "frontendpolicy" shown earlier. DNS is allowed egress to any destination IP hence the second flow entry above does not have any specific IP to match against. 

The sixth flow entry matches against source IP, which is 10.222.1.47, which is the backend1 pod IP in this case. The same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "5".

The seventh and eight flow entries match against the destination IP to see if it is either of the IPs; 10.222.1.47 or 10.222.2.34. These flow entries has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "1".

<b> So conjunction 1 is fully implemented by fifth, seventh and eighth flow entries.</b> Conjunction 1 checks if the source IP is 10.222.1.48 and then if the destination is TCP 80 and then if the destination IP is either 10.222.1.47 or 10.222.2.34. This corresponds to TCP 80 specific rule in the egress section of the Kubernetes network policy named as "frontendpolicy".

**Note :** The sixth flow entry mentioned above has got nothing to do with Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy", it actually corresponds to the egress rule used in the Kubernetes Network Policy "backendpolicy" and will be explained in a seperate section.

The ninth flow entry defines two actions for conjunction 2 as soon as all fields of conjunction 2 (which is explained above with second,third and fifth flow entries) is matched. First action is to set the register NXM_NX_REG5 with the conjunction id of "2" (0x2). The second action in the same flow entry is to hand over the flow to Table 70. (resubmit(,70))

The tenth flow entry defines two actions for conjunction 1 as soon as all fields of conjunction 1 (which is explained above with fifth,seventh and eigth flow entries) is matched. First action is to set the register NXM_NX_REG5 with the conjunction id of "1" (0x1). The second action in the same flow entry is to hand over the flow to Table 70. (resubmit(,70))

**Note :** NXM_NX_REG5 register is used to cache the conjunction id which is mapped to the egress Network Policy Rule in Antrea agent and also then written back to the Antrea custom resource definition in Kubernetes APIfor another feature of Antrea called "traceflow". More info on it can be found [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/traceflow-guide.md).

**The current flow (which is from frontend pod IP to backend2 pod IP on protocol TCP 80) matches conjunction 1 (defined in tenth flow entry) and it will be handed over to Table 70. So next stop is Table 70. (explained in Section 5.7 below)**

For reference, remaining flow entries are explained below : 

The eleventh flow entry also defines two actions for conjunction 5 as soon as all fields of conjunction 5 is matched. As mentioned before, this conjunction id has got nothing to do with "frontendpolicy" hence it will be explained in a seperate section.

Last flow entry in this table defines that if the flow does not match any of the above entries then the flow is handed over to Table 60 which is EgressDefaultTable. (resubmit(,60)) Table 60 is for isolation rules. Basically when a Kubernetes Network Policy is applied to a pod, the flows which do not match any of the allowed egress flows in Table 50 will be dropped by Table 60.

For reference, EgressDefault table on Worker 1 node is shown  below. As the current flow matches conjunction 1, Table 60 will be bypassed as the current flow is allowed by Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy" applied to frontend pod. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=60 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=60, priority=200,ip,nw_src=10.222.1.48 actions=drop
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=60, priority=200,ip,nw_src=10.222.1.47 actions=drop
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=60, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,70)
vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

Reason there are two source IPs in two different flow entries here is, there is an egress rule used in two different Kubernetes Network Policies; one is "frontendpolicy" applied to frontend pod, the other is "backendpolicy" applied to backend pods. Each of the first two flow entries in this table applies to the respective pod running on Worker 1 node. 

The last flow entry in Table 60 basically hands over all the flows (which did not match any of the conjunctions in Table 50 nor the drop flow entries in Table 60) to the next table , Table 70.

## 9.7 L3Forwarding Table #70

Basically each flow entry in this flow table checks either the destination IP address or destination MAC address (in some entries both) to make a forwarding decision. 

The current flow' s source and destination MAC and IP address values are still as they are shown back in Section 9. Shown below again. 

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Source MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)
- Destination MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (When the destination pod is on a different node this global virtual MAC is used. It is explained in Section 12) 

Based on the current flow' s source and destination MAC/IP values. The flow matches the seventh flow entry in Table 70, since the destination IP matches the "nw_dst" field. There are several actions in this seventh flow entry which are explained below : 

- First action decrements the TTL ("dec_ttl") since the destination IP of the flow is on another subnet than the one frontend pod is so this flow is actually a routed flow.  

- Second action modifies the source MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_src: 4e:99:08:c1:53:be" to the antrea-gw0 interface of Worker 1 node

- Third action modifies the destination MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_dst: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" 

- Fourth action sets the "NXM_NX_REG1" bit to "0x1" (by load:0x1 in hex, which is 1 in decimal). This register represents the egress OF Port ID of the flow. (ie which OF port should be the output port for this flow) And "1" is the OF Port ID for the tunnel0 interface for overlay networking between nodes (geneve_sys_6081 interface on Linux). The outputs and diagrams shown in Section 3.4 can be reviewed again to see OF Port ID.

- Fifth action sets the "NXM_NX_REG0[16]" to "1" (by load:0x1). This value in Reg0[16] means that OVS knows the destination MAC address. In other words this MAC address exists in OVS MAC address table (Table 80), which is explained in a seperate section. 

- Sixth action sets the "NXM_NX_TUN_IPV4_DST" to "0x4f0aca" which corresponds to 10.79.1.202 in IP. Meaning that the tunnel destination for this flow should be Worker 2 node. 

- Seventh action is "resubmit(,105)" which basically hands over the flow to Table 105. Hence next stop is Table 105. 

Note : The flow here skips Table 80 (L2 Forwarding) and 90 (Ingress Rules) since those tables are not relevant for traffic which is destined to a tunnel interface. 

## 9.8 ConntrackCommit Table #105

Table 105 on Worker 1 is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=105 --no-stats
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=200,ct_state=+new+trk,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520,exec(load:0x20->NXM_NX_CT_MARK[]))</b>
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=190,ct_state=+new+trk,ip actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,110)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table is for committing all the new flows for tracking them. This action is specifically explained as "Commit the connection to the connection tracking module which will be stored beyond the lifetime of packet in the pipeline." [in OVS docs](https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/tutorials/ovs-conntrack/).

The first flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). The same flow entry also checks if the flow is coming from the gateway interface. This is represented by reg0=0x1/0xffff. Explanation of this is as following. The second part "0xffff" instructs OVS to verify the first 16 bits in reg0, meaning reg0[0..15] and then the first part "0x1" means the result of that check should be "1". So it basically checks reg0[0..15]. The Reg0[0..15] is set in Classifier Table 10 and it is set to "1" if the flow comes from antrea-gw0 interface. 

The second flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). The action for this flow entry is committing this tracked flow to conntrack table (actions=ct(commit,..)) and then handing the flow over to the next table (,table=110).

The current flow is a NEW and TRACKED flow and additionally it is coming from the gateway interface hence its reg0[0..15] was already set to "1" earlier in Table 10 (Section 5.1). So the current flow matches the first flow entry in Table 105. The actions in the first flow entry is to commit this tracked flow to conntrack table and hand it over to Table 110 (actions=ct(commit,table=110..)) and also set the NXM_NX_CT_MARK[] register to 0x20 (load:0x20) . The next stop is Table 110.

**Note :** NSM_NX_CT_MARK register is used at a later stage for identifying the response from the backend2 pod and take the appropriate action on that return traffic. The reason is backend2 pod' s response to the current flow will have to be steered back to antrea-gw0 interface on Worker 1 node for ip tables NAT rule processing. (Section 8.4) Why ? Because this flow has come from the backendsvc service (from iptables processing) and will be delivered to the backend2 pod (although the source IP is frontend pod IP and destination IP is backend2 pod IP).


## 9.9 L2ForwardingOut Table #110

Table 110 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

This table' s job is simple. First flow entry in this table first reads the value in register reg0[16]. The reg0[16] was set to "1" back in L3Forwarding Table #70 (Section 9.7) . "1" means the destination MAC address in the current flow is known to OVS. And then the same flow entry reads the value in "NXM_NX_REG1" to see which OF port is the output port for this flow. 

The value of REG1  was set to "0x1" (which is "1" in decimal) also back in L3Forwarding Table #70. "1" is the OF Port ID of tunnel0 interface (geneve_sys_6081 interface on Linux). Hence the OVS sends this flow onwards to the tunnel0 interface to be encapsulated with GENEVE headers. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=110 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=200,ip,reg0=0x10000/0x10000 actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

**Note :** The second flow entry in this table obviously drops the flows which do not have their "reg0[16]" register set.

The logic of "reg0=-0x10000/0x10000" in the flow entry is that the first 0x10000 is the desired value of thie register. The second 0x10000 is the exact instructions on which specific bit(s) should be verified to match the desired value. Since "0x" is hexadecimal, below is a detailed explanation of the position of the bit that is verified. 

<pre><code>
23            16  15            8   7             0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>

## 9.10 Encapsulation from Worker 1 to Worker 2

When the flow gets to tunnel0 interface on Worker 1 node, which essentially is the geneve_sys_6081 named interface on Linux, the interface adds the GENEVE headers to the flow with the destination IP address of 10.79.1.202 (which was set in Table 70 earlier) and source IP of 10.79.1.201 which is Worker 1 node IP. Next the flow will be sent through the ens160 interface of the Worker 1 node onwards to the physical network, destined to the Worker 2 node.

A quick tcpdump on the ens160 interface of the Worker 1 node would reveal this, shown below. UDP 6081 is the GENEVE port.

<pre><code>

The source and destination IP/MAC are the ens160 interfaces of the Worker 1 and Worker 2 nodes. Highlighted above. The inner IP/MAC can also be seen in the same output.

# 9.11 Worker 2 Node OVS Flow Process

When the Worker 2 node receives the flow on its ens160 interface, the Linux Kernel IP stack knows that geneve_system_6081 interface (tunnel0) is responsible for decapsulation of this flow, so it strips the outer headers and then reads the GENEVE header. At this stage the inner headers have the following IP/MAC. (they have not changed since previous section)

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Source MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)
- Destination MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (When the destination pod is on a different node this global virtual MAC is used. It is explained in Section 12) 

### 9.11.1 Classifier Table #0

Table #0 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=0 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, priority=200,in_port="antrea-gw0" actions=load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],resubmit(,10)
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, priority=200,in_port="antrea-tun0" actions=move:NXM_NX_TUN_METADATA0[28..31]->NXM_NX_REG9[28..31],load:0->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[19],resubmit(,30)</b>
 cookie=0x1030000000000, priority=190,in_port="coredns--d8f62c" actions=load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],resubmit(,10)
 cookie=0x1030000000000, priority=190,in_port="backend2-202ff6" actions=load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],resubmit(,10)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table is to classify the traffic by matching it on the ingress port and then setting the register NXM_NX_REG0[0..15] bits as following; "0" for tunnel, "1" for local gateway and "2" for local pod. 

The current flow came from tunnel0 interface hence it matches the <b>second</b> flow entry in the above output (which is highlighted). There are multiple actions in the second flow entry.

- First action is 

- Second action is to set the reg0[0..15] to "0", meaning that this traffic has come to the OVS from the tunnel interface.

- Third action is 

- Fourth action is to hand the flow over to the next table, which is Table 30.

### 9.11.2 ConntrackTable Table #30

Table #30 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=30 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=30, priority=200,ip <b>actions=ct(table=31</b>,zone=65520)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

Conntrack table' s job is to start tracking all the traffic. ("ct" action means connection tracking). Any flow that goes through this table will be in "tracked" (trk) state. In generic networking security terms this functionality makes the OVS a stateful connection aware component. Flow then gets handed over to the next table which is Table 31; as seen in the "actions" section of the flow entry. (actions=ct(table=31,)) So next stop is Table 31.

**Note :** Zone ID is explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/ovs-pipeline.md#conntracktable-30) as "A ct_zone is simply used to isolate connection tracking rules. It is similar in spirit to the more generic Linux network namespaces, but ct_zone is specific to conntrack and has less overhead." 

### 9.11.3 ConnTrackState Table #31

Table #31 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=31 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=210,<b>ct_state=-new+trk</b>,ct_mark=0x20,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=200,<b>ct_state=-new+trk</b>,ct_mark=0x20,ip actions=load:0x2d84e3f921d->NXM_OF_ETH_DST[],resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=190,<b>ct_state=+inv+trk</b>,ip actions=drop
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,40)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

ConntrackState table processes all the flows that are in tracked state (basically which were handed over by the Conntrack table 30). The first and second flow entries shown above process the flows where the flow is NOT new AND tracked. (ct_state=-new means not new, +trk means being tracked) The third flow entry processes the flows where the respective flow is INVALID and TRACKED, basically it drops all those flows.

The current flow is a completely NEW flow destined to backend2 pod. Hence the flow matches the <b>last entry</b> in the flow table highlighted above. Notice the action in the same flow entry is handing the flow over to the next table which is table 40 (resubmit(,40)). So next stop is Table 40.

### 9.11.4 ConnTrackState Table #40

Table #40 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=40 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1040000000000, table=40, priority=200,ip,nw_dst=10.96.0.0/12 actions=mod_dl_dst:02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d,load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG1[],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[16],resubmit(,105)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=40, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,50)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table in essence checks whether if the flow is destined to a Kubernetes service so that it can redirect the flow to the antrea-gw0. 

The table has only two flow entries. The first flow entry checks whether if the destination IP of the flow is part of the service CIDR range configured in the cluster (which is 10.96.0.0/12); if it does, then certain actions are taken on the flow to steer the flow to the antrea-gw0 interface on the node.  

The destination IP of the current flow is backend2 pod IP (10.222.2.34) and it does not fall into the service CIDR range in the first flow entry in Table 40. Hence the current flow will match the second/last entry. The action specified in the last flow entry is to basically hand over the flow to Table 50 (actions=resubmit(,50)). So next stop is Table 50.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram at Antrea Project' s Github repo, there are tables 45-49 before Table50. However those tables are in use only when ClusterNetworkPolicy (CNP) feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, CNP is not used. 

### 9.11.5 EgressRule Table #50

At this stage, the flow is in Table 50. On Worker 2 node this table consists of the corresponding flow entries of the egress rules that are configured in Kubernetes Network Policy "backendpolicy" only, it does not have any entries related to egress rules that are configured in Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy" since there are <b>no frontend pods running on Worker 2 node</b>. (Section 3 can be revisited for the content of the "backendpolicy") 

Table 50 on Worker 2 node is shown below. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=50 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=50, priority=210,ct_state=-new+est,ip actions=resubmit(,70)
 cookie=0x1050000000000, table=50, priority=200,ip,nw_src=10.222.2.34 actions=conjunction(2,1/2)
 cookie=0x1050000000000, table=50, priority=190,conj_id=2,ip actions=load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG5[],resubmit(,70)
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=50, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,60)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

The current flow is from frontend pod to backend2 pod and it is a NEW flow. Hence it will match the last entry in this table. The last entry has a single action which is handing the flow over to Table 60 (resubmit(,60)) . Hence nextstop is Table 60.

### 9.11.5 EgressDefaultRule Table #60

Table 60 on Worker 2 node is shown below. As mentioned in the previous section, there will only be egress rules related to Kubernetes Network Policy "backendpolicy" on this node. Hence the default drop rule only checks the source IP as the backend2 pod' s IP (10.222.2.34).  

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=60 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=60, priority=200,ip,nw_src=10.222.2.34 actions=drop
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=60, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,70)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

The current flow is from frontend pod to backend2 pod. The source IP in the current flow is frontend pod IP (10.222.1.48) . Hence it will match the last entry in this table. The last entry has a single action which is handing the flow over to Table 70 (resubmit(,70)) . Hence nextstop is Table 70.

### 9.11.6 L3Forwarding Table #70

The Table 70 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=70 --no-stats

Basically each flow entry in this flow table checks either the destination IP address or destination MAC address (in some entries both) to make a forwarding decision. 

The current flow' s source and destination MAC and IP address values are still as they are shown back in Section 9.11. Shown below again. 

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Source MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)
- Destination MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (When the destination pod is on a different node this global virtual MAC is used. It is explained in Section 12) 

Based on the current flow' s source and destination MAC/IP values. The flow matches the third flow entry in Table 70, since the destination IP and MAC matches the "nw_dst"  and "dl_dst" fields. There are several actions in this third flow entry which are explained below : 

- First action modifies the source MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_src:02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d" to the antrea-gw0 interface of Worker 2 node

- Second action modifies the destination MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_dst:c6:f4:b5:76:10:38" to the backend2 pod's MAC

- Third action decrements the TTL ("dec_ttl") since the destination IP of the flow is on another subnet than the one frontend pod is so this flow is actually a routed flow.  

- Fourth action is "resubmit(,80)" which basically hands the flow over to Table 80. Hence next stop is Table 80. 

### 9.11.7 L2ForwardingCalc Table #80

Table 80 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=80 --no-stats

What this table does is not that different than a typical IEEE 802.1d transparent bridge. This is basically the MAC address table of the OVS. Based on the destination MAC address of the flow OVS decides on which egress port (OF Port) the flow should be sent to. 

Two registers, both of which mentioned in earlier sections, are used in each flow entry in this table. 

- Reg1 is used to store the egress OF port ID of the flow, which will be used later on in Table 110 (L2ForwardingOut Table).
- Reg0[16] is used and it is set to "1" to indicate that the given flow has a matching destination address in this table, which is known to OVS, and it should be forwarded. 

As seen in the highlighted flow entry above in the table, for the current flow, which has a destination MAC address of c6:f4:b5:76:10:38 (the MAC of backend2 pod) matches this third flow entry. The actions in the third flow entry are as following : 

- set the reg1 register to "0x23".  0x23 in hexadecimal corresponds to [2 x (16 to the power of 1) + 3 x (16 to the power of 0)] = 35. And "35" is the OF port id of backend2 pod on the OVS.  
- set the reg0[16] register to "1" (Hex : 0x1) . 
- hand over the flow to Table 90 by "resubmit(,90)"

Hence next stop is Table 90.

Just to emphasize once more, as a result of the actions mentioned in above bullets, OVS now knows that the destination of fhis flow is egress OF port 35 and the destination MAC address is known. However there is still more processing that needs to be done, as Table 90 and onwards.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram at Antrea Project' s Github repo, there are tables 85-89 before Table 90. However those tables are in use only when ClusterNetworkPolicy (CNP) feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, CNP is not used. 


# 10. Phase 3 - Backend Pod to Service

# 11. Phase 4 - Service to Frontend Pod
