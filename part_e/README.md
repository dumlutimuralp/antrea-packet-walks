# PART E

This section explains the **direct** packet flow between pods, which are **running on different Kubernetes nodes**, in four main steps.

- [13. Worker1 (Phase1)](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_e#13-worker1-phase-1)
- [14. Worker2 (Phase1)](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/blob/master/part_e/README.md#14-worker2-phase-1)
- [15. Worker2 (Phase2)](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_e#15-worker2-phase-2)
- [16. Worker1 (Phase2)](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/blob/master/part_e/README.md#16-worker-1-phase-2)

# 13. Worker1 (Phase 1)
[Back to table of contents](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_e#part-e)

The flow that will be explained in this section is shown below. Notice that this pattern is a <b>direct flow</b> from frontend pod (10.222.1.48) on worker1 node to backend2 pod (10.222.2.34) on worker2 node) <b>not through Kubernetes service.</b>

![](2020-10-20_14-55-53.png)

A simple "curl 10.222.2.34" (or "curl 10-222-2-34.default.pod.cluster.local where "default" is the namespace) executed on frontend pod on worker1 node would generate this flow. To emphasize again, here a direct request is made to backend2 pod, not through a Kubernetes service.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ k exec -it frontend -- sh
/ # curl 10.222.2.34
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - backend2 - 10.222.2.34/24
/ # 
</code></pre>

While performing curl command on frontend pod, getting a quick tcpdump from the pod (in a different terminal window) would reveal the source and destination IP/MAC of the flow. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ k exec -it frontend -- sh
/ # 
/ # 
/ # tcpdump -en
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
09:59:55.973231 <b>be:2c:bf:e4:ec:c5 > 4e:99:08:c1:53:be</b>, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 74: 10.222.1.48.40468 > 10.222.2.34.80: Flags [S], seq 373695439, win 64860, options [mss 1410,sackOK,TS val 1573094794 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
<b>OUTPUT OMITTED</b>

/ # 
</code></pre>

As seen above, the flow has the following values in the Ethernet and IP headers.

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Source MAC = be:2c:bf:e4:ec:c5 (frontend pod MAC)
- Destination MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)

This flow will be matched against a flow entry in each OVS Table, processed top to bottom in each individual table, based on the priority value of the flow entry in the table.

## 13.1 Classifier Table #0

Table #0 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=0 --no-stats

 cookie=0x1000000000000, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

This table is to classify the current flow by matching it on the ingress port and then setting the register NXM_NX_REG0[0..15] bits as following; "0" for tunnel, "1" for local gateway and "2" for local pod.  The current flow in this scenario, which is initiated from frontend pod and comes to OVS on the frontend pod interface, matches the <b>sixth</b> flow entry in the above output (which is highlighted). First action in this flow entry is to set the value of the register reg0[0..15] to "0x2", which means flow comes from a local pod. Second action in the same flow entry is to hand the flow over to next table which is Table 10. (resubmit(,10))  
So next stop is Table 10.

**Note :** "0x" means that it is hexadecimal. For example, 

- "0x2" is 2 Ã— (16 to the power of 0) = 2 x 1 = 2 (in decimal)
- or "0x20" is 2 x (16 to the power of 1) + 0 x (16 to the power of 0)  =  32 + 0 = 32 (in decimal)

## 13.2 Spoofguard Table #10

Table #10 on Worker 1 node is shown below. "nw_src" refers to the IP address and "dl_src" refers to the MAC address of the pod connected to the respective OF port.

<pre><code>

</code></pre>

What this table does is verifying if the source IP and MAC of the current flow matches the IP and MAC assigned to the Pod by Antrea CNI plugin during initial Pod connectivity. It implements this check both for IP and ARP traffic.

Highlighted lines in the above output are the respective ARP and IP check entries for the OF port which the frontend pod is connected to. In this instance this is an IP flow from frontend pod to backend2 pod hence the current flow will match the **tenth flow entry**, second line from the bottom. Notice, in the same flow entry, the action is to hand the flow over to Table 30 (actions=resubmit(,30)). Table 30 is the next stop.

## 13.3 Conntrack Table #30

Table #30 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

Conntrack table' s job is to start tracking all the traffic. ("ct" action means connection tracking) Any flow that goes through this table will be in "tracked" (trk) state. In generic networking security terms this functionality makes the OVS a stateful connection aware component. Flow then gets handed over to the next table which is Table 31; as seen in the "actions" section of the flow entry (actions=ct(table=31,)). Next stop is Table 31.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=30 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=30, priority=200,ip <b>actions=ct(table=31,zone=65520)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

**Note :** "Zone" is explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/ovs-pipeline.md#conntracktable-30) as following : "A ct_zone is simply used to isolate connection tracking rules. It is similar in spirit to the more generic Linux network namespaces, but ct_zone is specific to conntrack and has less overhead." 

## 13.4 ConntrackState Table #31

Table #31 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=31 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=210,<b>ct_state=-new+trk</b>,ct_mark=0x20,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=200,<b>ct_state=-new+trk</b>,ct_mark=0x20,ip actions=load:0x4e9908c153be->NXM_OF_ETH_DST[],resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=190,<b>ct_state=+inv+trk</b>,ip actions=drop
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,40)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

ConntrackState table processes all the flows that are in tracked state (basically which were handed over by the Conntrack table 30). The first and second flow entries shown above process the flows where the flow is NOT new AND tracked. (ct_state=-new means not new, +trk means being tracked) The third flow entry processes the flows where the respective flow is INVALID and TRACKED, basically it drops all those flows. 

The current flow is a completely NEW flow from frontend pod to backend2 pod. Hence the current flow will match the <b>last entry</b> in the flow table highlighted above. Notice the action in that flow entry is handing the flow over to the next table which is table 40. (resubmit(,40)) Next stop is Table 40.

## 13.5 DNAT Table #40

Table #40 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=40 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1040000000000, table=40, priority=200,ip,w_dst=10.96.0.0/12 actions=mod_dl_dst:4e:99:08:c1:53:be,load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG1[],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[16],resubmit(,105)
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=40, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,50)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table in essence checks whether if the flow is destined to a Kubernetes service so that it can redirect the flow to the antrea-gw0. 

The table has only two flow entries. The first flow entry checks whether if the destination IP of the flow is part of the service CIDR range configured in the cluster (which is 10.96.0.0/12); if it does, then certain actions are taken on the flow to steer the flow to the antrea-gw0 interface on the Worker 1 node.  

As mentioned before, the current flow is a direct flow between two pods. It is not a flow destined to a Kubernetes service. The destination IP of the flow is the backend2 pod IP (10.222.2.34) and it does not fall into the service CIDR range in the first flow entry in Table 40. Hence the current flow will match the second/last entry. The action specified in the last flow entry is to basically hand the flow over to Table 50 (actions=resubmit(,50)). So next stop is Table 50.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram [here](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/blob/master/part_a/README.md#2-ovs-pipeline), there are tables 45,49 before Table50. However those tables are in use only when Antrea Network Policy feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, it is not used. 

## 13.6 EgressRule Table #50

At this stage, the flow is in Table 50. 

Table 50 has flow entries which correspond to the egress rules configured in Kubernetes Network Policies applied to all the pods on Worker 1 node. There is a frontend pod and a backend1 pod on the Worker 1 node. "frontendpolicy" is applied to frontend pod and "backendpolicy" is applied to backend1 pod and backend2 pod (on Worker2) . 

Since the current flow comes from frontend pod, the content of the "frontendpolicy" is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl get netpol frontendpolicy
NAME             POD-SELECTOR    AGE

vmware@master:~$ 
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

The egress section of this network policy is highlighted in the above output. In this network policy, frontend pod can initiate HTTP to backend pods and it can initiate DNS to anywhere. All other egress traffic from frontend pod will be denied. 

**Note :** The reason DNS is also allowed is, if the frontend pod sends a request to the backend2 pod by its DNS name (10-222-2-34.default.pod.cluster.local), then a DNS query is sent by frontend pod to Kubernetes DNS so that frontend pod can call out backend2 pod IP, hence DNS has to be allowed to make this work. **As mentioned before, this article focuses on the actual application flow which occurs after the DNS query. In this section the flow from frontend pod to backend2 pod on TCP port 80 is explained.**

The Table 50 on Worker 1 node is shown below. 

<pre><code>

</code></pre>

First thing to understand from above table is OVS uses "conjunctive" match across multiple fields alongside "conjunction" action. This enables OVS to optimize policy implementation without consuming too many flow entries.

The first flow entry in Table 50 above checks whether if the flow is an already established flow (-new,+est); if it is then there is no need to process the flow against the remaining flow entries in this table since Kubernetes Network Policy is STATEFUL by nature. However the current flow is a NEW flow hence it does NOT match this first flow entry.

The second flow entry matches against a given source or destination IP set. But there is no specific IP that this flow entry checks upon apparently. Same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "2".

The third flow entry matches against destination protocol, which is UDP 53 (DNS) in this case. Same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "2". 

The fourth flow entry matches against destination protocol, which is TCP 80 (HTTP) in this case. Same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "1".

The fifth flow entry matches against a specific source IP, which is frontend pod IP - 10.222.1.48. The same flow entry has a conjunction action with both an id of "1" and "2".

**Note :** The x/y notation in the conjunctions are to represent whether if the conjunction has multiple conditions to match and which condition the current flow represents.For example 3,2/3 means the given flow entry is the second out of three conjunctions for the conjunction id 3.

<b>So conjunction 2 is fully implemented by second, third and fifth flow entries.</b> Conjunction 2 checks if the source IP address is 10.222.1.48 and if the destination protocol is UDP 53. This corresponds to the DNS specific rule in the egress section of the Kubernetes network policy named as "frontendpolicy" shown earlier. DNS is allowed egress to any destination IP hence the second flow entry above does not have any specific IP to match against. 

The sixth flow entry matches against source IP, which is 10.222.1.47, which is the backend1 pod IP in this case. The same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "5".

The seventh and eight flow entries match against the destination IP to see if it is either of the IPs; 10.222.1.47 or 10.222.2.34. These flow entries has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "1".

<b> So conjunction 1 is fully implemented by fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth flow entries.</b> Conjunction 1 checks if the source IP is 10.222.1.48 and then if the destination is TCP 80 and then if the destination IP is either 10.222.1.47 or 10.222.2.34. This corresponds to TCP 80 specific rule in the egress section of the Kubernetes network policy named as "frontendpolicy".

**Note :** The sixth flow entry mentioned above has got nothing to do with Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy", it actually corresponds to the egress rule used in the Kubernetes Network Policy "backendpolicy" which is not relevant here.

The ninth flow entry defines two actions for conjunction 2 as soon as all fields of conjunction 2 (which is explained above with second, third and fifth flow entries) is matched. First action is to set the register NXM_NX_REG5 with the conjunction id of "2" (0x2). The second action in the same flow entry is to hand the flow over to Table 70. (resubmit(,70))

The tenth flow entry defines two actions for conjunction 1 as soon as all fields of conjunction 1 (which is explained above with fourth, fifth,seventh and eigth flow entries) is matched. First action is to set the register NXM_NX_REG5 with the conjunction id of "1" (0x1). The second action in the same flow entry is to hand the flow over to Table 70. (resubmit(,70))

**Note :** NXM_NX_REG5 register is used to cache the conjunction id which is mapped to the egress Network Policy Rule in Antrea agent and also then written back to the Antrea custom resource definition in Kubernetes API for another feature of Antrea called "traceflow". More info on it can be found [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/traceflow-guide.md).

**The current flow, which is from frontend pod IP to backend2 pod IP on protocol TCP 80, matches conjunction 1 (defined in tenth flow entry) and it will be handed over to Table 70. So next stop is Table 70. (explained in Section 13.7)**

For reference, remaining flow entries are explained below : 

The eleventh flow entry also defines two actions for conjunction 5 as soon as all fields of conjunction 5 is matched. As mentioned before, this conjunction id has got nothing to do with "frontendpolicy" and it is not relevant here. It actually corresponds to the egress rules configured in "backendpolicy".

Last flow entry in this table defines that if the flow does not match any of the above entries then the flow is handed over to Table 60 which is EgressDefaultTable (resubmit(,60)). Table 60 is for isolation rules. Basically when a Kubernetes Network Policy is applied to a pod, the flows which do not match any of the entries in Table 50 will be dropped by Table 60.

For reference, EgressDefault Table #60 on Worker 1 node is shown  below. As the current flow matches conjunction 1 in Table 50, Table 60 will be bypassed.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=60 --no-stats

vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

Reason there are two source IPs in two different flow entries here is, there is an egress rule used in two different Kubernetes Network Policies; one is "frontendpolicy" applied to frontend pod, the other is "backendpolicy" applied to backend pods. Each of the first two flow entries in this table used to deny the traffic from the respective pod running on Worker 1 node. 

The last flow entry in Table 60 basically hands all the flows (which did not match any of the conjunctions in Table 50 nor the drop flow entries in Table 60) over to the next table , Table 70.

## 13.7 L3Forwarding Table #70

The Table 70 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

Basically each flow entry in this flow table checks either the destination IP address or destination MAC address (in some entries both) to make a forwarding decision. 

The current flow' s source and destination MAC and IP address values are still as they are shown back in Section 13. Shown below again. 

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Source MAC = be:2c:bf:e4:ec:c5 (frontend pod MAC)
- Destination MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)

Based on the current flow' s source and destination MAC/IP values the flow matches the **seventh** flow entry in Table 70, since the destination IP matches the "nw_dst" field. There are several actions in this seventh flow entry which are explained below : 

- First action is to decrement the TTL ("dec_ttl") since the destination IP of the flow is on another subnet than the one frontend pod is, so this flow is actually a routed flow.  

- Second action is to modify the source MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_src: 4e:99:08:c1:53:be" (which is the antrea-gw0 interface MAC of Worker 1 node)

- Third action is to modify the destination MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_dst: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" (This MAC address is related to ARP processing and is explained in [Part D Section 12](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_d)).

- Fourth action is to set the "NXM_NX_REG1" bit to "0x1" (by load:0x1 in hex, which is 1 in decimal). This register represents the OF Port ID which this flow will be sent through.  "1" is the OF Port ID for the tunnel0 interface (genev_sys_6081 interface on Linux) used for overlay networking between Kubernetes worker nodes. The outputs and diagrams shown in [Part A Section 3.4](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_a#34-identifying-ovs-port-ids-of-port-ids) can be reviewed again to see OF Port ID.

- Fifth action is to set the "NXM_NX_REG0[16]" to "1" (by load:0x1). This value in Reg0[16] means that the destination MAC address in the flow is known to OVS. In other words this MAC address exists in OVS MAC address table (Table 80), which is explained in a seperate section. 

- Sixth action is to set the "NXM_NX_TUN_IPV4_DST" to "0x4f0aca" which corresponds to 10.79.1.202 in IP. Meaning that the destination node for this flow should be Worker 2 node since 10.79.1.202 is the ens160 interface IP of the Worker 2 node.

- Seventh action is "resubmit(,105)" which basically hands the flow over to Table 105. Hence next stop is Table 105. 

**Note :** The flow here skips Table 80 (L2 Forwarding) and 90 (Ingress Rules). The OF Port ID of the port which this flow will be sent through is already written to register Reg1 and the ingress rules will be processed at the other end (Worker 2 node) cause the receiving pod is on a different node. 

## 13.8 ConntrackCommit Table #105

Table 105 on Worker 1 is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=105 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=200,ct_state=+new+trk,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520,exec(load:0x20->NXM_NX_CT_MARK[]))
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=190,ct_state=+new+trk,ip actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520)</b>
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,110)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table is for committing all the new flows for tracking them. This action is specifically explained as "Commit the connection to the connection tracking module which will be stored beyond the lifetime of packet in the pipeline." [in OVS docs](https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/tutorials/ovs-conntrack/).

The first flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). The same flow entry also checks if the flow is coming from the gateway interface. This is represented by reg0=0x1/0xffff. Explanation of this is as following. The second part "0xffff" instructs OVS to verify the first 16 bits in reg0, meaning reg0[0..15] and then the first part "0x1" means the result of that check should be "1". So it basically checks reg0[0..15]. The Reg0[0..15] is set in Classifier Table 10 and it is set to "1" if the flow comes from antrea-gw0 interface. 

The second flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). 

In this case the current flow matches the second flow entry. It is not coming from the gateway interface; it is coming from a local pod interface (frontend pod interface on OVS). It is a new flow from frontend pod to backend2 pod and it is being tracked (previously from Conntrack Table 30 and 31). Hence the current flow is committed to conntrack table (actions=ct(commit,..)) and then it is handed over to the next table (,table=110). So next stop is Table 110.

## 13.9 L2ForwardingOut Table #110

Table 110 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

This table' s job is simple. First flow entry in this table first reads the value of register reg0[16] in the flow. If the value of this register is "1" in decimal, that means the destination MAC address is known to OVS and the flow should be able to get forwarded (otherwise it would get dropped). The same flow entry has an action defined as "actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]". What this action does is it reads the value in "NXM_NX_REG1" to determine the OF port this flow will be sent through and then sends the flow onwards to that port.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=110 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=200,ip,reg0=0x10000/0x10000 actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

The value of reg0[16] in the current flow was set to "1" back in L3Forwarding Table #70 (Section 13.7). The value of REG1 in the current flow was set to "0x1" (which is "1" in decimal) also back in L3Forwarding Table #70. "1" is the OF Port ID of tunnel0 interface (genev_sys_6081 interface on Linux). **Hence the OVS sends the current flow onwards to the tunnel0 interface.** 

**Note :** The second flow entry in this table obviously drops the flows which do not have their "reg0[16]" register set.

The logic of "reg0=-0x10000/0x10000" in the flow entry is that the first 0x10000 is the desired value of this register. The second 0x10000 is the exact instructions on which specific bit(s) should be verified to match the desired value. Since "0x" is hexadecimal, below is a detailed explanation of the position of the bit that is verified. 

<pre><code>
23              16  15               8   7               0
0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 1   0 0 0 0 |  0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>

So bit 16 must be "1", and that is being verified in "reg0". The first four bits on the left hand side is not worth to mention hence the desired value and actual value are both shown as "0x10000". 

## 13.10 Encapsulation from Worker 1 to Worker 2

When the current flow gets to tunnel0 (genev_sys_6081) interface on Worker 1 node, Linux IP Stack adds the GENEVE headers to the flow with the destination IP address of 10.79.1.202 (which was determined in Table 70 back in Section 13.7 earlier) and source IP of 10.79.1.201 which is Worker 1 node IP. **Next, the flow is sent through the ens160 interface of the Worker 1 node onwards to the physical network, destined to the Worker 2 node.**

To verify how Worker 1 node encapsulates the flows, a quick tcpdump on the Worker 1 node ens160 interface on UDP 6081, which is GENEVE port, would reveal the source and destination IP/MAC of this flow. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -it frontend -- sh
/ # curl 10.222.2.34
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - backend2 - 10.222.2.34/24
</code></pre>

While performing curl on frontend pod (as shown above), in another ssh session to the Kubernetes Worker 1 node :

<pre><code>
vmware@worker1:~$ sudo tcpdump -i ens160 -en udp port 6081
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on ens160, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

<b>OUTPUT OMITTED</b>

</code></pre>

The source and destination IP/MAC are the ens160 interfaces of the Worker 1 and Worker 2 nodes. Highlighted above. The inner IP/MAC can also be seen in the same output.

**Note:** Notice "vni 0x0" that is the actual network ID used in the GENEVE header for this traffic. Apparently no specific ID needs to be used cause OVS keeps track of each flow individually.

# 14. Worker2 (Phase 1)
[Back to table of contents](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_e#part-e)

In this section the processing of the flow, which is from frontend pod to backend2 pod, on worker2 node will be explained.

![](2020-10-20_16-03-52.png)

When the Worker 2 node receives the flow, the Linux Kernel IP stack reads the GENEVE header, strips it out and then sends the flow over to the tunnel0 (genev_sys_6081) interface.

At this stage the inner headers have the following IP/MAC. (they have not changed since Section 13)

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Source MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)
- Destination MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (When the destination pod is on a different node this global virtual MAC is used. It is explained in [Part D Section 12](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_d#12-arp-process). 

## 14.1 Classifier Table #0

Table #0 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=0 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, priority=200,in_port="antrea-gw0" actions=load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],resubmit(,10)
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, priority=200,in_port="antrea-tun0" actions=move:NXM_NX_TUN_METADATA0[28..31]->NXM_NX_REG9[28..31],load:0->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[19],resubmit(,30)</b>
 cookie=0x1030000000000, priority=190,in_port="coredns--d8f62c" actions=load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],resubmit(,10)
 cookie=0x1030000000000, priority=190,in_port="backend2-202ff6" actions=load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],resubmit(,10)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table is to classify the current flow by matching it on the ingress port and then setting the register NXM_NX_REG0[0..15] bits as following; "0" for tunnel, "1" for local gateway and "2" for local pod. 

The current flow comes from tunnel0 interface hence it matches the <b>second</b> flow entry in the above output (which is highlighted). There are multiple actions in the second flow entry.

- First action is "move:NXM_NX_TUN_METADATA0[28..31]->NXM_NX_REG9[28..31]" which actually writes a tag which is used by another feature of Antrea called "traceflow". More info on it can be found [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/traceflow-guide.md).

- Second action is to set the reg0[0..15] to "0", meaning that this traffic has come to OVS from the tunnel interface

- Third action is to set the NXM_NX_REG0[19] to "1" (0x1), meaning that the MAC addresses in this flow needs to be rewritten (since this is a routed flow that came from another node)

- Fourth action is to hand the flow over to the next table, which is Table 30 (resubmit(,30)).

**Notice that the flow bypasses Spoofguard Table 10.**

## 14.2 ConntrackTable Table #30

Table #30 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=30 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=30, priority=200,ip <b>actions=ct(table=31</b>,zone=65520)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

Conntrack table' s job is to start tracking all the traffic. ("ct" action means connection tracking). Any flow that goes through this table will be in "tracked" (trk) state. In generic networking security terms this functionality makes the OVS a stateful connection aware component. Flow then gets handed over to the next table which is Table 31; as seen in the "actions" section of the flow entry. (actions=ct(table=31,)) So next stop is Table 31.

**Note :** Zone ID is explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/ovs-pipeline.md#conntracktable-30) as "A ct_zone is simply used to isolate connection tracking rules. It is similar in spirit to the more generic Linux network namespaces, but ct_zone is specific to conntrack and has less overhead." 

## 14.3 ConnTrackState Table #31

Table #31 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=31 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=210,<b>ct_state=-new+trk</b>,ct_mark=0x20,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=200,<b>ct_state=-new+trk</b>,ct_mark=0x20,ip actions=load:0x2d84e3f921d->NXM_OF_ETH_DST[],resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=190,<b>ct_state=+inv+trk</b>,ip actions=drop
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,40)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

ConntrackState table processes all the flows that are in tracked state (basically which were handed over by the Conntrack table 30). The first and second flow entries shown above process the flows where the flow is NOT new AND tracked. (ct_state=-new means not new, +trk means being tracked) The third flow entry processes the flows where the respective flow is INVALID and TRACKED, basically it drops all those flows.

The current flow is a completely NEW flow destined to backend2 pod. Hence the flow matches the <b>last entry</b> in the flow table highlighted above. Notice the action in the same flow entry is handing the flow over to the next table which is table 40 (resubmit(,40)). So next stop is Table 40.

## 14.4 ConnTrackState Table #40

Table #40 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=40 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1040000000000, table=40, priority=200,ip,nw_dst=10.96.0.0/12 actions=mod_dl_dst:02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d,load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG1[],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[16],resubmit(,105)
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=40, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,50)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table in essence checks whether if the flow is destined to a Kubernetes service so that it can redirect the flow to the antrea-gw0. 

The table has only two flow entries. The first flow entry checks whether if the destination IP of the flow is part of the service CIDR range configured in the cluster (which is 10.96.0.0/12); if it does, then certain actions are taken on the flow to steer the flow to the antrea-gw0 interface on the node.  

As mentioned before, the current flow is a direct flow between two pods. It is not a flow destined to a Kubernetes service. The destination IP of the current flow is backend2 pod IP (10.222.2.34) and it does not fall into the service CIDR range in the first flow entry in Table 40. Hence the current flow will match <b>the second/last entry</b>. The action specified in the last flow entry is to basically hand over the flow to Table 50 (actions=resubmit(,50)). So next stop is Table 50.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram [here](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/blob/master/part_a/README.md#2-ovs-pipeline), there are tables 45,49 before Table50. However those tables are in use only when Antrea Network Policy feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, it is not used. 

## 14.5 EgressRule Table #50

At this stage, the flow is in Table 50. 

On Worker 2 node Table 50 has flow entries which correspond to the egress rules that are configured in Kubernetes Network Policy "backendpolicy" only; it does not have any flow entries related to egress rules that are configured in Kubernetes Network Policy "frontendpolicy" since there are <b>no frontend pods running on Worker 2 node</b>. 

Table 50 on Worker 2 node is shown below. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=50 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=50, priority=210,ct_state=-new+est,ip actions=resubmit(,70)
 cookie=0x1050000000000, table=50, priority=200,ip,nw_src=10.222.2.34 actions=conjunction(2,1/2)
 cookie=0x1050000000000, table=50, priority=190,conj_id=2,ip actions=load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG5[],resubmit(,70)
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=50, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,60)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

The current flow is from frontend pod to backend2 pod and it is a NEW flow. Hence it will match the last entry in this table (highlighted above). The same flow entry has a single action which is handing the flow over to Table 60 (resubmit(,60)). Hence next stop is Table 60.

**Note :** The flow from frontend pod has already been processed by Table 50 on worker1 node (Section 13.6), hence one may ask "Why the need to process the flow once again by Table 50 on worker2 node. This could be a future enhancement for Antrea ?

## 14.6 EgressDefaultRule Table #60

Table 60 on Worker 2 node is shown below. As mentioned in the previous section, there will only be egress rules related to Kubernetes Network Policy "backendpolicy" on this node. Hence the default drop rule only checks the source IP as the backend2 pod' s IP (10.222.2.34).  

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=60 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=60, priority=200,ip,nw_src=10.222.2.34 actions=drop
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=60, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,70)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

The current flow is from frontend pod to backend2 pod hence the source IP is frontend pod IP (10.222.1.48) . Hence it will match the last entry in this table. The last entry has a single action which is handing the flow over to Table 70 (resubmit(,70)). Hence next stop is Table 70.

## 14.7 L3Forwarding Table #70

The Table 70 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>

Basically each flow entry in this flow table checks either the destination IP address or destination MAC address (in some entries both) to make a forwarding decision. 

The current flow' s source and destination MAC and IP address values are still as they are shown back in Section 14. Shown below again. 

- Source IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Source MAC = 4e:99:08:c1:53:be (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 1)
- Destination MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (When the destination pod is on a different node this global virtual MAC is used. It is explained in Section 12) 

Based on the current flow' s source and destination MAC/IP values. The flow matches the third flow entry in Table 70, since the destination IP and MAC matches the "nw_dst" and "dl_dst" fields. The following actions are taken on the flow : 

- modify the source MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_src:02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d" to the antrea-gw0 interface MAC of Worker 2 node
- modify the destination MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_dst:c6:f4:b5:76:10:38" to the backend2 pod's MAC
- decrement the TTL ("dec_ttl") since this is a routed flow
- resubmit the flow to Table 80 ("resubmit(,80)")

Hence next stop is Table 80. 

## 14.8 L2ForwardingCalc Table #80

Table 80 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

What this table does is not that different than a typical IEEE 802.1d transparent bridge. This is basically the MAC address table of the OVS. Based on the destination MAC address of the flow OVS decides on which egress port (OF Port) the flow should be sent to. 

Each flow entry in this table sets two registers, both of which mentioned in earlier sections, will be explained here once again. 

- Reg1 is used to store OF port ID of the the OVS port which the flow should be sent to. Based on the destination MAC address of the flow this register is set with the respective OF port ID.  This register will be used later on in Table 110 (L2ForwardingOut Table).
- The way Reg0[16] is used is that if it is set to "1" then that indicates that the given flow has a matching destination address in this table, which is known to OVS, and it should be forwarded. 

As seen in the highlighted flow entry above in the table, for the current flow, which has a destination MAC address of c6:f4:b5:76:10:38 (the MAC of backend2 pod) matches this third flow entry. The actions in the third flow entry are as following : 

- set the reg1 register to "0x23".  0x23 in hexadecimal corresponds to [2 x (16 to the power of 1) + 3 x (16 to the power of 0)] = 35. And "35" is the OF port id of backend2 pod on the OVS.  
- set the reg0[16] register to "1" (Hex : 0x1)  
- hand over the flow to Table 90 by "resubmit(,90)"

Hence next stop is Table 90.

Just to emphasize once more, as a result of the actions mentioned in above bullets, OVS now knows that the destination of fhis flow is OF port 35 and the destination MAC address is known. However there is still more processing that needs to be done, as Table 90 and onwards.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram [here](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/blob/master/part_a/README.md#2-ovs-pipeline), there are tables 85,89 before Table 90. However those tables are in use only when Antrea Network Policy feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, it is not used. 


## 14.9 IngressRule Table #90

At this stage, the flow is in Table 90. 

Table 90 has flow entries only which correspond to the ingress rules configured in Kubernetes Network Policy "backendpolicy". Cause there is only backend2 pod on the Worker 2 node. 

In this section the current flow will be matched against the ingress rules of the Kubernetes Network Policy "backendpolicy"; since it is the policy which is applied to the backend2 pod and backend2 pod is the receiver of the flow. 

Kubernetes Network Policy named as "backendpolicy" is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl get netpol backendpolicy

The Table 90 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=90 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=90, priority=210,ct_state=-new+est,ip actions=resubmit(,105)

 cookie=0x1050000000000, table=90, priority=200,tcp,tp_dst=80 actions=conjunction(1,3/3)

 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=90, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,100)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

The first flow entry checks whether if the flow is an already established flow (-new,+est); if it is then there is no need to process the flow against the remaining flow entries, since Kubernetes Network Policy is STATEFUL by nature. However the current flow is a NEW flow hence it does NOT match this first flow entry.

The second flow entry matches on the source IP of 10.222.2.1 (antrea-gw0 IP). The same flow entry has an action of handing the flow over to Table 105. This flow entry is used by the kubelet process on the node to probe local pods. More info can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). 

The third flow entry matches on source IP of 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP). The same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "1".

The fourth flow entry matches on destination protocol and port which is TCP 80. The same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "1".

The fifth flow entry matches on the OF port id where the flow will be delivered to (reg1=0x23). 0x23 corresponds to 35 in decimal, which is the OF port that the backend2 pod is connected to. This is an additional check (verifying the OF port ID of the receiver) that the ingress table implements in addition to source IP check. The same flow entry has a conjunction action with a conjunction id of "1".

<b>So conjunction 1 is fully implemented by third, fourth and fifth flow entries.</b> Conjunction 1 checks if the source IP is 10.222.1.48 and then if the destination is TCP 80 and then if the destination OF port id is "35". This actually corresponds to TCP 80 specific rule in the ingress section of the Kubernetes Network Policy named as "backendpolicy".

The sixth flow entry defines two actions for conjunction 1 as soon as all fields of conjunction 1 (which is explained above with third, fourth and fifth flow entries) is matched. First action is to set the register NXM_NX_REG6 with the conjunction id of "1" (0x1). The second action in the same flow entry is to hand the flow over to the next table which is Table 105. (resubmit(,105))

**Note :** NXM_NX_REG6 register is used to cache the conjunction id which is mapped to the ingress Network Policy Rule in Antrea agent and also then written back to the Antrea custom resource definition in Kubernetes API for another feature of Antrea called "traceflow". More info on it can be found [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/traceflow-guide.md).

**The current flow (which is from frontend pod IP to backend2 pod IP on protocol TCP 80) matches conjunction 1 (defined in sixth flow entry) and it will be handed over to Table 105. So next stop is Table 105. (explained in Section 14.10 below)**

For reference, remaining flow entries are explained below : 

Last flow entry in Table 90 defines that if the flow does not match any of the above entries then the flow will be handed over to Table 100 which is IngressDefaultTable (resubmit(,100)). Table 100 is for isolation rules. Basically when a network policy is applied to a pod, the flows which do not match any of the allowed ingress flows in Table 90 will be dropped by Table 100.

For reference, IngressDefault table on Worker 2 can be seen below. As the current flow matched conjunction 1, it bypasses Table 100. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=100 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=100, priority=200,ip,reg1=0x23 actions=drop
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=100, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,105)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

First flow entry drops all the other flows destined to the OF port 0x23 which the backend2 pod is connected to.

The second/last flow entry in Table 100 basically hands all the flows, which do not match any of the conjunctions in Table 90 or the first flow entry in Table 100, to the next table - Table 105. 

## 14.10 ConntrackCommit Table #105

Table 105 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=105 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=200,ct_state=+new+trk,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520,exec(load:0x20->NXM_NX_CT_MARK[]))
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=190,ct_state=+new+trk,ip actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520)</b>
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,110)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table is for committing all the new flows for tracking them. This action, ct(commit,), is specifically explained as "Commit the connection to the connection tracking module which will be stored beyond the lifetime of packet in the pipeline." [in OVS docs](https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/tutorials/ovs-conntrack/).

The first flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). The same flow entry also checks if the flow is coming from the gateway interface. This is represented by reg0=0x1/0xffff. Explanation of this is as following. The second part "0xffff" instructs OVS to verify the first 16 bits in reg0, meaning reg0[0..15] and then the first part "0x1" means the result of that check should be "1". So it basically checks reg0[0..15]. The Reg0[0..15] is set by Classifier Table 10 and it is set to "1" if the flow comes from antrea-gw0 interface. 

The second flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). 

In this case the current flow matches this <b>second</b> flow entry. It is not coming from the gateway interface; it is coming from the tunnel interface.   It is a new flow from frontend pod to backend2 pod and it is being tracked (previously from Conntrack Table 30 and 31). The following actions are taken on the flow :

- commit this tracked flow to conntrack table (actions=ct(commit,..)) 
- hand the flow over to the next table (,table=110)

The next stop is Table 110. 

## 14.11 L2ForwardingOut Table #110

Table 110 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=110 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=200,ip,reg0=0x10000/0x10000 actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table' s job is simple. First flow entry in this table first reads the value in register reg0[16]. If the value of this register is "1" in decimal, that means the destination MAC address is known to OVS and the flow should be able to get forwarded (otherwise it would get dropped). The same flow entry has an action defined as "actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]". What this action does is it reads the value in "NXM_NX_REG1" to determine the OF port this flow will be sent through and then sends the flow onwards to that port.

The current flow' s reg0[16] bit was set to "0x1" (1 in decimal)  back in DNAT Table 40 and the value of REG1 was set to "0x23" (35 in decimal) also back in Table 80 in Section 14.8.  "35" is the OF Port ID of backend2 pod. **Hence the current flow is sent onwards to the backend2 pod.**

**Note :** The second flow entry in this table obviously drops the flows which do not have their "reg0[16]" register set.

The logic of "reg0=-0x10000/0x10000" in the flow entry is that the first 0x10000 is the desired value of this register. The second 0x10000 is the exact instructions on which specific bit(s) should be verified to match the desired value. Since "0x" is hexadecimal, below is a detailed explanation of the position of the bit that is verified. 

<pre><code>
23              16  15               8   7               0
0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 1   0 0 0 0 |  0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>

So bit 16 must be "1", and that is being verified in "reg0". The first four bits on the left hand side is not worth to mention hence the desired value and actual value are both shown as "0x10000". 

# 15. Worker2 (Phase 2)
[Back to table of contents](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_e#part-e)

In this section the processing of the flow, which is the response from backend2 pod (on Worker 2 node) to the frontend pod (on Worker 1 node), on worker 2 node will be explained. 

![](2020-10-20_16-30-44.png)

To verify how backend2 pod responds to requests from the frontend pod, a quick tcpdump on the backend2 pod would reveal the source and destination IP/MAC of this flow. It is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -it frontend -- sh
/ # curl 10.222.2.34
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - backend2 - 10.222.2.34/24
</code></pre>

While performing curl on frontend pod (as shown above), in another ssh session to the Kubernetes master node :

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -it backend2 -- sh
/ #  tcpdump -en
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode

09:24:10.938278 <b>c6:f4:b5:76:10:38 > 02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d</b>, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 74: <b>10.222.2.34.80 > 10.222.1.48.49140</b>: Flags [S.], seq 4118006349, ack 4201074306, win 64308, options [mss 1410,sackOK,TS val 3333905778 ecr 4044015621,nop,wscale 7], length 0
</code></pre>

As seen above the first line is the request that comes ingress to backend1 pod, the second line (highlighted) is the response of the backend2 pod to the request. This response will be explained in this section. The flow has the following values in the Ethernet and IP headers.

Source IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
Destination IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
Source MAC = c6:f4:b5:76:10:38 (backend2 pod MAC)
Destination MAC = 02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 2)

This flow will be matched against a flow entry in each OVS Table, processed top to bottom in each individual table, based on the priority value of the flow entry in the table.

## 15.1 Classifier Table #0

Table #0 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=0 --no-stats

 <b>cookie=0x1030000000000, priority=190,in_port="backend2-202ff6" actions=load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG0[0..15],resubmit(,10)</b>
 cookie=0x1000000000000, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table is to classify the current flow by matching it on the ingress port and then setting the register NXM_NX_REG0[0..15] bits as following; "0" for tunnel, "1" for local gateway and "2" for local pod. 

The current flow came from backend2 pod interface hence it matches the <b>fourth</b> flow entry in the above output (which is highlighted). The first action in this flow entry sets the reg0[0..15] to "2" since the flow comes from a local pod. The second action in this flow entry is to hand the flow over to the next table, which is Table 10 (resubmit(,10)). Hence next stop is Table 10.


## 15.2 Spoofguard Table #10

Table #10 on Worker 1 node is shown below. "nw_src" refers to the IP address and "dl_src" refers to the MAC address of the pod connected to the respective OF port.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=10 --no-stats

 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=10, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

What this table does is verifying if the source IP and MAC of the current flow matches the IP and MAC assigned to the Pod by Antrea CNI plugin during initial Pod connectivity. It implements this check both for IP and ARP traffic.

Since the flow comes from the backend2 pod with backend2 pod' s IP and MAC, the flow will match the <b>sixth</b> flow entry in this table and the spoofguard check succeeds. The only action specified in the sixth flow entry is handing the flow over to Table 30 (actions=resubmit(,30)). So next stop is Table 30.

## 15.3 ConntrackTable Table #30

Table #30 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=30 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=30, priority=200,ip <b>actions=ct(table=31</b>,zone=65520)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

Conntrack table' s job is to start tracking all the traffic. ("ct" action means connection tracking). Any flow that goes through this table will be in "tracked" (trk) state. In generic networking security terms this functionality makes the OVS a stateful connection aware component. Flow then gets handed over to the next table which is Table 31; as seen in the "actions" section of the flow entry. (actions=ct(table=31,)) So next stop is Table 31.

**Note :** Zone ID is explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/ovs-pipeline.md#conntracktable-30) as "A ct_zone is simply used to isolate connection tracking rules. It is similar in spirit to the more generic Linux network namespaces, but ct_zone is specific to conntrack and has less overhead." 

## 15.4 ConntrackTable Table #31

Table #31 on Worker 2 node is shown below. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=31 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=210,ct_state=-new+trk,ct_mark=0x20,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=200,ct_state=-new+trk,ct_mark=0x20,ip actions=load:0x2d84e3f921d->NXM_OF_ETH_DST[],resubmit(,40)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=190,ct_state=+inv+trk,ip actions=drop
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=31, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,40)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

ConntrackState table processes all the flows that are in tracked state (basically which were handed over by the Conntrack table 30). 

The first flow entry implements three checks. First check is if the flow is not new and tracked ("ct_state=-new means not new, +trk means being tracked) . Second check is if the flow's "ct_mark" field is set to "0x20". Third check is if the flow comes from antrea-gw0 interface. (by checking the reg0[0..15] register of the flow to see if it is set to "0x1" which is "1" in decimal, representing local gateway, as explained back in Table 0) 

The second flow entry checks whether if the flow is not new and tracked ("ct_state=-new means not new, +trk means being tracked). It also checks if the flow's "ct_mark" field is set to "0x20". 

The third flow entry checks if the flow is INVALID but TRACKED, basically it drops all these types of flows.

The current flow from backend2 pod to frontend pod is NOT NEW and it is a TRACKED flow, so its "ct_state" is "-new+trk". However its "ct_mark" field **is not set.** ("ct_mark" is used for tracking flows destined to Kubernetes services, as explained in Part B and Part C)

Hence the current flow will match the **last** flow entry in the flow table highlighted above. The action in the same flow entry is handing the flow over to the next table which is table 40 (resubmit(,40). So next stop is Table 40.

## 15.5 DNAT Table #40

Table #40 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=40 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1040000000000, table=40, priority=200,ip,nw_dst=10.96.0.0/12 actions=mod_dl_dst:02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d,load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG1[],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[16],resubmit(,105)
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=40, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,50)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table in essence checks whether if the flow is destined to a Kubernetes service so that it can redirect the flow to the antrea-gw0. 

The table has only two flow entries. The first flow entry checks whether if the destination IP of the flow is part of the service CIDR range configured in the cluster (which is 10.96.0.0/12); if it does, then certain actions are taken on the flow to steer the flow to the antrea-gw0 interface on the node.  

The destination IP of the current flow is frontend pod IP (10.222.1.48) and it does not fall into the service CIDR range in the first flow entry in Table 40. Hence the current flow will match the second/last entry. The action specified in the last flow entry is to basically hand over the flow to Table 50 (actions=resubmit(,50)). So next stop is Table 50.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram [here](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/blob/master/part_a/README.md#2-ovs-pipeline), there are tables 45,49 before Table50. However those tables are in use only when Antrea Network Policy feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, it is not used. 

## 15.6 EgressRule Table #50

Table 50 on Worker 2 node is shown below. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=50 --no-stats
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=50, priority=210,ct_state=-new+est,ip actions=resubmit(,70)</b>
 cookie=0x1050000000000, table=50, priority=200,ip,nw_src=10.222.2.34 actions=conjunction(2,1/2)
 cookie=0x1050000000000, table=50, priority=190,conj_id=2,ip actions=load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG5[],resubmit(,70)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=50, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,60)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

The first flow entry in Table 50 above checks whether if the flow is an already established flow (-new,+trk); if it is then there is no need to process the flow against network policy, since Kubernetes Network Policy is STATEFUL by nature. 

The current flow is actually the response of backend2 pod to frontend pod as part of the previous request from frontend pod (the flow which is explained in previous sections). Because of this reason the current flow is not NEW and it is part of an already ESTABLISHED flow.

Hence the current flow will match the **first** flow entry in this table ("ct_state=-new+est"). The action specified in this first flow entry is handing the flow over to Table 70 (actions=resubmit(,70)). So next stop is Table 70. 

## 15.7 L3Forwarding Table #70

The Table 70 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=70 --no-stats

vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

Basically each flow entry in this flow table checks either the destination IP address or destination MAC address (in some entries both) to make a forwarding decision. 

The current flow' s source and destination MAC and IP address values are still as they are shown back in Section 10. Shown below again. 

- Source IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Source MAC = c6:f4:b5:76:10:38 (backend2 pod MAC)
- Destination MAC = 02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 2 node)

Based on the current flow' s source and destination MAC/IP values. The flow matches the **fifth** flow entry in Table 70, since the destination IP matches the subnet specified in "nw_dst" field. There are several actions in this fifth flow entry which are explained below : 

- First action is to decrement the TTL ("dec_ttl") since this is a routed flow

- Second action is to modify the source MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_src:02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d" to the antrea-gw0 interface MAC of Worker 2 node

- Third action is to modify the destination MAC address of the flow "mod_dl_dst:aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" (When the destination pod is on a different node this global virtual MAC is used. It will be explained in [Part D Section 12](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_d)) 

- Fourth action is to set the "NXM_NX_REG1" bit to "0x1" (by load:0x1 in hex, which is 1 in decimal). This register represents the OF Port ID which this flow will be sent through.  "1" is the OF Port ID for the tunnel0 interface on Worker 2 node (genev_sys_6081 interface on Linux) used for overlay networking between Kubernetes worker nodes. The outputs and diagrams shown in [Part A Section 3.4](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_a#34-identifying-ovs-port-ids-of-port-ids) can be reviewed again to see OF Port ID.

- Fifth action is to set the "NXM_NX_REG0[16]" to "1" (by load:0x1). This value in Reg0[16] means that the destination MAC address in the flow is known to OVS. In other words this MAC address exists in OVS MAC address table (Table 80), which is explained in a seperate section. 

- Sixth action is to set the "NXM_NX_TUN_IPV4_DST" to "0xa4f01c9" which corresponds to 10.79.1.201 in IP. Meaning that the destination node for this flow should be Worker 1 node since 10.79.1.201 is the ens160 interface IP of the Worker 1 node.

- Seventh action is "resubmit(,105)" which basically hands the flow over to Table 105. Hence next stop is Table 105. 

## 15.8 ConntrackCommit Table #105

Table 105 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=105 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=200,ct_state=+new+trk,ip,reg0=0x1/0xffff actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520,exec(load:0x20->NXM_NX_CT_MARK[]))
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=190,ct_state=+new+trk,ip actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520)
 <b>cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,110)</b>
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table is for committing all the new flows for tracking them. This action, ct(commit,), is specifically explained as "Commit the connection to the connection tracking module which will be stored beyond the lifetime of packet in the pipeline." [in OVS docs](https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/tutorials/ovs-conntrack/).

The first flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). The same flow entry also checks if the flow is coming from the gateway interface. This is represented by reg0=0x1/0xffff. Explanation of this is as following. The second part "0xffff" instructs OVS to verify the first 16 bits in reg0, meaning reg0[0..15] and then the first part "0x1" means the result of that check should be "1". So it basically checks reg0[0..15]. The Reg0[0..15] is set by Classifier Table 10 and it is set to "1" if the flow comes from antrea-gw0 interface. 

The second flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). 

The current flow does **NOT** match the first nor the second flow entry in this table. Because the current flow is the response of backend2 pod, hence it is part of an already established flow and it matches the **last entry** in this table. The action in the last flow entry is specified as "resubmit(,110)" which basically is handing the flow over to the Table 110. So next stop is Table 110.

## 15.9 L2ForwardingOut Table #110

Table 110 on Worker 2 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-fv5x9 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=110 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=200,ip,reg0=0x10000/0x10000 actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table' s job is simple. First flow entry in this table first reads the value in register reg0[16]. If the value of this register is "1" in decimal, that means the destination MAC address is known to OVS and the flow should be able to get forwarded (otherwise it would get dropped). The same flow entry has an action defined as "actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]". What this action does is it reads the value in "NXM_NX_REG1" to determine the OF port this flow will be sent through and then sends the flow onwards to that port.

The current flow' s reg0[16] bit was set to "0x1" (1 in decimal)  back in Table 70 and the value of REG1 was set to "0x1" (1 in decimal) also back in Table 70 in Section 15.7.  "1" is the OF Port ID of tunnel interface (genev_sys_6081 on Linux) on Worker 2 node. **Hence the current flow is sent onwards to the tunnel0 interface on Worker 2 node.**

**Note :** The second flow entry in this table obviously drops the flows which do not have their "reg0[16]" register set.

The logic of "reg0=-0x10000/0x10000" in the flow entry is that the first 0x10000 is the desired value of this register. The second 0x10000 is the exact instructions on which specific bit(s) should be verified to match the desired value. Since "0x" is hexadecimal, below is a detailed explanation of the position of the bit that is verified. 

<pre><code>
23              16  15               8   7               0
0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 1   0 0 0 0 |  0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>

So bit 16 must be "1", and that is being verified in "reg0". The first four bits on the left hand side is not worth to mention hence the desired value and actual value are both shown as "0x10000". 

## 15.10 Encapsulation from Worker 2 to Worker 1

When the current flow gets to tunnel0 (genev_sys_6081) interface on Worker 2 node, Linux IP Stack adds the GENEVE headers to the flow with the destination IP address of 10.79.1.201 (which was determined in Table 70 back in Section 15.7 earlier) and source IP of 10.79.1.202 which is Worker 2 node IP. **Next, the flow is sent through the ens160 interface of the Worker 2 node onwards to the physical network, destined to the Worker 1 node.**

To verify how Worker 2 node encapsulates the flows, a quick tcpdump on the Worker 2 node ens160 interface on UDP 6081, which is GENEVE port, would reveal the source and destination IP/MAC of this flow. 

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -it frontend -- sh
/ # curl 10.222.2.34
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - backend2 - 10.222.2.34/24
</code></pre>

while performing curl on frontend pod (as shown above), in another ssh session to the Kubernetes Worker 2 node :

<pre><code>
vmware@worker2:~$ sudo tcpdump -i ens160 -en udp port 6081

<b>OUTPUT OMITTED</b>
</code></pre>

The first line in the tcpdump output above is the ingress GENEVE flow on the Worker 2 node. The second line in the tcpdump output which is highlighted above is the egress GENEVE flow (the flow that is explained in the current section 15.1-15.10) on the Worker 2 node which corresponds to the response of backend2 pod to frontend pod' s request. The source and destination IP/MAC (highlighted above) are the ens160 interfaces of the Worker 2 and Worker 1 nodes. The inner IP/MAC of the current flow can also be seen in the same output. (The inner source MAC and destination MAC of the current flow were modified back in Table 70 in Section 15.7)

**Note:** Notice "vni 0x0" that is the actual network ID used in the GENEVE header for this traffic. Apparently no specific ID needs to be used cause OVS keeps track of each flow individually.

# 16. Worker 1 (Phase 2)
[Back to table of contents](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_e#part-e)

In this section the processing of the flow, which is the response from backend2 pod (on Worker 2 node) to the frontend pod (on Worker 1 node), on worker 1 node will be explained. 

When the worker 1 node receives the flow, the Linux Kernel IP stack reads the GENEVE header, strips it out and then sends the flow over to the tunnel0 (genev_sys_6081) interface.

At this stage the inner headers have the following IP/MAC. (they have not changed since Section 15.10)

- Source IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Source MAC = 02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 2)
- Destination MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (When the destination pod is on a different node this global virtual MAC is used. It is explained in [Part D Section 12](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_d#12-arp-process))

## 16.1 Classifier Table #0

Table #0 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>

vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

This table is to classify the current flow by matching it on the ingress port and then setting the register NXM_NX_REG0[0..15] bits as following; "0" for tunnel, "1" for local gateway and "2" for local pod. 

The current flow came from tunnel0 interface hence it matches the <b>second</b> flow entry in the above output (which is highlighted). There are multiple actions in the second flow entry.

- First action is "move:NXM_NX_TUN_METADATA0[28..31]->NXM_NX_REG9[28..31]" which actually writes a tag which is used by another feature of Antrea called "traceflow". More info on it can be found [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/traceflow-guide.md).

- Second action is to set the reg0[0..15] to "0", meaning that this traffic has come to OVS from the tunnel interface

- Third action is to set the NXM_NX_REG0[19] to "1" (0x1), meaning that the MAC addresses in this flow needs to be rewritten (since this is a routed flow that came from another node)

- Fourth action is to hand the flow over to the next table, which is Table 30 (resubmit(,30)).

**Notice that the flow bypasses Spoofguard Table 10.**

## 16.2 Conntrack Table #30

Table #30 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

Conntrack table' s job is to start tracking all the traffic. ("ct" action means connection tracking) Any flow that goes through this table will be in "tracked" (trk) state. In generic networking security terms this functionality makes the OVS a stateful connection aware component. Flow then gets handed over to the next table which is Table 31; as seen in the "actions" section of the flow entry (actions=ct(table=31,)). Next stop is Table 31.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=30 --no-stats

vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

**Note :** "Zone" is explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/ovs-pipeline.md#conntracktable-30) as following : "A ct_zone is simply used to isolate connection tracking rules. It is similar in spirit to the more generic Linux network namespaces, but ct_zone is specific to conntrack and has less overhead."

ConntrackState table processes all the flows that are in tracked state (basically which were handed over by the Conntrack table 30). The first and second flow entries shown above process the flows where the flow is NOT new AND tracked. (ct_state=-new means not new, +trk means being tracked) The third flow entry processes the flows where the respective flow is INVALID and TRACKED, basically it drops all those flows.

The current flow is a tracked flow since it is the continuity of the previous flow which was from frontend pod to backend2 pod (explained in Section 13) Hence the current flow is not new and it also does not have the "ct_mark" set. ("ct_mark" is used for tracking flows destined to Kubernetes services, as explained in Part B and Part C)

Hence the flow matches the <b>last entry</b> in the flow table highlighted above. Notice the action in the same flow entry is handing the flow over to the next table which is table 40 (resubmit(,40). So next stop is Table 40.


## 16.4 DNAT Table #40

Table #40 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=40 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1040000000000, table=40, priority=200,ip,w_dst=10.96.0.0/12 actions=mod_dl_dst:4e:99:08:c1:53:be,load:0x2->NXM_NX_REG1[],load:0x1->NXM_NX_REG0[16],resubmit(,105)
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=40, priority=0 actions=resubmit(,50)
vmware@master:~$ 
</code></pre>

This table in essence checks whether if the flow is destined to a Kubernetes service so that it can redirect the traffic to the antrea-gw0 on the Worker 1 node. 

The table has only two flow entries. The first flow entry checks whether if the destination IP of the flow is part of the service CIDR range configured in the cluster (which is 10.96.0.0/12); if it does, then certain actions are taken on the flow to steer the flow to the antrea-gw0 interface on the node.  

The destination IP of the current flow is frontend pod IP (10.222.1.48) and it does not fall into the service CIDR range in the first flow entry in Table 40. Hence the current flow matches the second/last flow entry. That flow entry basically hands the flow over to Table 50 (actions=resubmit(,50)) . So next stop is Table 50.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram [here](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/blob/master/part_a/README.md#2-ovs-pipeline), there are tables 45,49 before Table50. However those tables are in use only when Antrea Network Policy feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, it is not used.

The current flow is actually the response of backend2 pod to frontend pod as part of the previous flow from frontend pod (the flow which is explained back in section 13); because of this reason the current flow is not NEW and it is part of an already established flow.

Hence the current flow will match the first flow entry in this table ("ct_state=-new+est"). The action specified in this first flow entry is handing the flow over to Table 70. (actions=resubmit(,70)) So next stop is Table 70.

Basically each flow entry in this flow table checks either the destination IP address or destination MAC address (in some entries both) to make a forwarding decision. 

The current flow' s source and destination MAC and IP address values are as following.(they have not changed since Section 16)

- Source IP = 10.222.2.34 (backend2 pod IP)
- Destination IP = 10.222.1.48 (frontend pod IP)
- Source MAC = 02:d8:4e:3f:92:1d (antrea-gw0 interface MAC on Worker 2)
- Destination MAC = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 

Based on the current flow' s source and destination MAC/IP values, the current flow matches the **fifth** entry in Table 70. The actions in the last flow entry are following : 

- modify the source MAC of the flow to "4e:99:08:c1:53:be" which is antrea-gw0 interface MAC on worker1 node ("mod_dl_src:4e:99:08:c1:53:be") 
- modify the destination MAC of the flow to "be:2c:bf:e4:ec:c5" which is frontend pod's MAC ("mod_dl_dst:be:2c:bf:e4:ec:c5")
- decrement the TTL ("dec_ttl") since this is a routed flow
- resubmit the flow to Table 80 ("resubmit(,80)")

What this table does is not that different than a typical IEEE 802.1d transparent bridge. This is basically the MAC address table of the OVS. Based on the destination MAC address of the flow OVS decides which OF Port the flow should be sent to. 

Each flow entry in this table sets two registers, both of which mentioned in earlier sections, will be explained here once again. 

- Reg1 is used to store OF port ID of the flow (the OVS port which the flow should be sent to). This register is set with the respective OF port ID based on the destination MAC address of the flow. This register which stores the OF port ID will be used later on in Table 110 (L2ForwardingOut Table).
- Reg0[16] is used and it is set to "1" to indicate that the given flow has a matching destination address in this table, which is known to OVS, and it should be forwarded. 

The current flow has a destination MAC address of be:2c:bf:e4:ec:c5 (the MAC address of frontend pod) hence it matches the **fifth** flow entry in the table. The actions specified in the fifth flow entry are as following : 

- set the reg1 register to "0x31".  0x31 in hexadecimal corresponds to [3 x (16 to the power of 1) + 1 x (16 to the power of 0)] = 49. And "49" is the OF port id of frontend pod on the OVS. (which can be verified in [Part A Section 3.4](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/tree/master/part_a#34-identifying-ovs-port-ids-of-port-ids) Worker 1 output) 
- set the reg0[16] register to "1" (Hex : 0x1)  
- hand the flow over to Table 90 by "resubmit(,90)"

Hence next stop is Table 90.

Just to emphasize once more, as a result of the actions mentioned in above bullets, OVS now knows that the destination of fhis flow is egress OF port 49 and the destination MAC address is known. However there is still more processing that needs to be done, as Table 90 and onwards.

**Note :** In the OVS Pipeline diagram [here](https://github.com/dumlutimuralp/antrea-packet-walks/blob/master/part_a/README.md#2-ovs-pipeline), there are tables 85,89 before Table 90. However those tables are in use only when Antrea Network Policy feature of Antrea is used. In this Antrea environment, it is not used. 


## 16.8 IngressRule Table #90

The Table 90 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

This table consists of the corresponding flow entries of the ingress rules that are configured in Kubernetes Network Policies "frontendpolicy" and "backendpolicy" respectively.

The current flow is actually the response from the backend2 pod to frontend pod as part of the previous request from frontend pod (the flow which is explained in previous section 13); because of this reason the current flow is not NEW and it is part of an already established flow.

Hence the current flow will match the first flow entry in this table ("ct_state=-new+est"). The action specified in this first flow entry is handing the flow over to Table 105 (actions=resubmit(,105)). So next stop is Table 105. 

## 16.9 ConntrackCommit Table #105

Table 105 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>

 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=105, priority=190,ct_state=+new+trk,ip actions=ct(commit,table=110,zone=65520)

This table is for committing all the new flows for tracking them. This action is specifically explained as "Commit the connection to the connection tracking module which will be stored beyond the lifetime of packet in the pipeline." [in OVS docs](https://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/tutorials/ovs-conntrack/).

The first flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk). The same flow entry also checks if the flow is coming from the gateway interface. This is represented by reg0=0x1/0xffff. Explanation of this is as following. The second part "0xffff" instructs OVS to verify the first 16 bits in reg0, meaning reg0[0..15] and then the first part "0x1" means the result of that check should be "1". So it basically checks reg0[0..15]. The Reg0[0..15] is always set by Classifier Table 10 and it is set to "1" if the flow comes from antrea-gw0 interface. 

The second flow entry checks whether if the flow is a new flow (+new) and if it is a tracked flow (+trk).

The current flow does **not** match the first nor the second flow entry in this table. It is an already established flow hence the current flow will match the **last entry** in this table. The action in the last flow entry is specified as "resubmit(,110)" which basically hands the flow over to the Table 110. So next stop is Table 110.

## 16.10 L2ForwardingOut Table #110

Table 110 on Worker 1 node is shown below.

<pre><code>
vmware@master:~$ kubectl exec -n kube-system -it antrea-agent-f76q2 -c antrea-ovs -- ovs-ofctl dump-flows br-int table=110 --no-stats
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=200,ip,reg0=0x10000/0x10000 actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]
 cookie=0x1000000000000, table=110, priority=0 actions=drop
vmware@master:~$
</code></pre>

This table' s job is simple. First flow entry in this table first reads the value in register reg0[16]. If the value of this register is "1" in decimal, that means the destination MAC address is known to OVS and the flow should be able to get forwarded (otherwise it would get dropped). The same flow entry has an action defined as "actions=output:NXM_NX_REG1[]". What this action does is it reads the value in "NXM_NX_REG1" to determine the OF port this flow will be sent through and then sends the flow onwards to that port.

The value of REG0[16] was set to "0x1" back in L2ForwardingCalc Table #80. The value of REG1 was set to "0x31" (which is "49" in decimal) also back in L2ForwardingCalc Table #80. "49" is the OF Port ID of frontend pod interface. Hence the OVS sends this flow onwards to the frontend pod. **At this stage frontend pod successfully receives the response from backend2 pod.**

**Note :** The second flow entry in this table obviously drops all the other flows which do not have their "reg0[16]" register set.

The logic of "reg0=-0x10000/0x10000" in the flow entry is that the first 0x10000 is the desired value of this register. The second 0x10000 is the exact instructions on which specific bit(s) should be verified to match the desired value. Since "0x" is hexadecimal, below is a detailed explanation of the position of the bit that is verified. 

<pre><code>
23              16  15               8   7               0
0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 1   0 0 0 0 |  0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>

So bit 16 must be "1", and that is being verified in "reg0". The first four bits on the left hand side is not worth to mention hence the desired value and actual value are both shown as "0x10000".
