# [Antrea](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea) Packet Walks 

_**This disclaimer informs readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in this series of posts belong solely to the author, and not necessarily to the authorâ€™s employer, organization, committee or other group or individual.**_

This article explains the step by step packet walks for a given application flow in the Open vSwitch (OVS) dataplane implemented by Antrea CNI within a Kubernetes cluster. The high level packet walks and the OVS Pipeline are already explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/architecture.md#pod-networking) and [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/ovs-pipeline.md) at Project Antrea' s page on Github.

The purpose of this article is to walk the reader through an actual flow pattern between a frontend pod to a Kubernetes service and explain the forwarding decisions made from that specific flow' s point of view with some other details and more wording.

_**Special thanks to [Quan Tian](https://github.com/tnqn), [Wenying Dong](https://github.com/wenyingd), [Ran Gu](https://github.com/gran-vmv) for responding to my queries about specific registers and forwarding steps.**_
