# Packet Walks with [Antrea CNI](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea)

This article explains the step by step packet walks for a simple application flow in the Open vSwitch (OVS) dataplane implemented by Antrea CNI within a Kubernetes cluster. The high level packet walks are already explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/architecture.md#pod-networking), at Antrea' s project repo on Github.
