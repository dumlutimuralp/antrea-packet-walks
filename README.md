# Packet Walks with [Antrea CNI](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea)

This article explains the step by step packet walks for a given application flow in the Open vSwitch (OVS) dataplane implemented by Antrea CNI within a Kubernetes cluster. The high level packet walks are already explained [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/blob/master/docs/architecture.md#pod-networking), at Antrea' s project repo on Github.

Special thanks to [Quan Tian](https://github.com/tnqn), [Wenying Dong](https://github.com/wenyingd), [Ran Gu](https://github.com/gran-vmv) for their support in addressing questions about registers and OpenFlow actions.
